                            <p>This time, we decided to do something different with Power Rankings. Since even among analysts, we have a hard time agreeing with numbered lists, we decided to tier teams based on overall perceived strength. And while there were certain disagreements about where certain teams lie (AHQ down, KOO up, CLG up, C9 down, etc), we all were fairly confident that this ranking augers just how far the competing teams will making in the tournament.</p>
                            <p>Let us know if you like the format, and give feedback on Power Rankings in the comments below, or on Twitter, where your submission will be disseminated into The Matrix.</p>
                            <p>The following people contributed to Worlds 2015 Power Rankings:</p>
                            <p>Alex Manisier, Christopher "Montecristo" Mykles, Ryanne "Froskurinn" Mohr, Carlos "H0tsawce" Bravo, Emily Rand, Nelson Sng, Leah "Riot SpiNN" Jackson, Jason "Riot Jayway" Wai, and Frank "Riot Mirhi" Fields.</p>

                            <p class="event-sub">This fall the North American Collegiate Championship (NACC) returns for its third season with a new format aimed at taking college esports to the next level. Learn more about this season’s changes and find out how your campus can get involved!</p>
                            <p>Last year was a huge milestone for college esports, with over 1,600 college teams and 300 schools from across the U.S. and Canada participating in the NACC. However, with so many teams competing, it was nearly impossible for you to watch, follow, and cheer for your favorite college teams throughout the season.</p>
                            <p>In order to improve this experience we’re running an open qualifier in November that will determine who the 32 best college teams are in North America. This way we can focus on top-tier collegiate play and provide you with more opportunities to follow and cheer on your favorite teams throughout the school year.</p>
                            <p>Read on to learn more about this year’s changes and how your campus can get involved!</p>
                            <p class="event-sub">What's the new format?</p>
                            <p><img class="activator" src="img/events/2016-nacc-format-shrunk.jpg"></p>
                            <p>Any eligible college team can register to participate in the Open Qualifier in November. Split by region, the four qualifier brackets will determine the 8 teams that will represent each region in the 2016 NACC Regular Season. After each conference crowns their champion, the 4 best college teams in NA will battle it out live at the 2016 NACC Final!</p>
                            <p class="event-sub">What’s on the line?</p>
                            <p>As in years past, teams participating in the North American Collegiate Championship are competing for scholarships and bragging rights as best college team NA. Each player who earns a spot in the 2016 NACC Regular Season will be taking home a scholarship to further their education.</p>
                            <p class="event-sub">How do I get involved?</p>
                            <p>Look for an announcement on lolesports.com when registration opens on October 5th. It’s completely free to register and play. Each team must have 6 total eligible players to participate.</p>
